# Release Notes - Version 2.1

**Release Date**: August 31, 2025  
**Focus**: Enhanced Boundary Detection and Fragment Filtering

## 🎯 Overview

Version 2.1 introduces significant improvements to boundary detection accuracy, especially when operating without the OpenAI API (fallback mode). The key enhancement is automatic fragment detection and filtering, which prevents incomplete document sections from being merged with valid statements.

## ✨ New Features

### 🔍 Enhanced Fragment Detection
- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies incomplete document sections and fragments
- **Confidence Scoring**: Assigns confidence levels based on multiple criteria
- **Smart Filtering**: Automatically excludes low-confidence fragments (< 0.3)
- **Transparent Logging**: Clear reporting of what content is filtered and why

### 📊 Improved Fallback Processing
- **Text-Based Analysis**: Enhanced pattern matching for statement headers
- **Multi-Criteria Validation**: Checks for bank names, account info, and statement periods
- **Strong Header Detection**: Better identification of valid statement boundaries
- **Pattern Recognition**: Improved recognition of fragment vs. statement patterns

### ✅ Validation Enhancements
- **Fragment Awareness**: Validation accounts for intentionally skipped pages
- **Dynamic Tolerances**: Adjusts file size validation when fragments are filtered
- **Detailed Reporting**: Shows fragment handling in validation results

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Critical: Boundary Detection Issue Resolved
**Issue**: In fallback mode, document fragments were being merged with valid statements, causing incorrect boundary detection and mixed content in output files.

**Root Cause**: Weak pattern matching couldn't distinguish between fragments and complete statements.

**Resolution**: 
- Enhanced fallback detection with text analysis
- Automatic fragment detection and filtering
- Improved validation to handle filtered content

**Impact**: 
- Cleaner output files with no fragment contamination
- Better accuracy in fallback mode (without OpenAI API)
- Improved user experience with transparent fragment handling

## 🔄 Improvements

### Performance
- More accurate boundary detection in fallback mode
- Faster processing with early fragment detection
- Reduced false positives in statement separation

### User Experience
- Clear logging of fragment detection decisions
- Better error messages and warnings
- Improved dry-run mode showing fragment analysis

### Reliability
- More consistent output quality
- Better handling of edge cases
- Improved validation accuracy

## 📋 Technical Details

### Modified Components

#### `llm_analyzer.py`
- Added `_enhanced_fallback_with_text()` method
- Implemented `_is_fragment_page()` for fragment detection
- Enhanced confidence scoring in `_fallback_metadata_extraction()`
- Improved pattern matching for bank names (added NAB patterns)

#### `workflow.py` 
- Added fragment filtering in `_pdf_generation_node()`
- Enhanced `_validate_output_integrity()` to handle skipped pages
- Added tracking for `skipped_fragments` and `skipped_pages`
- Improved validation tolerance for filtered content

#### `WorkflowState`
- Added `skipped_fragments` and `skipped_pages` fields
- Better state tracking for fragment handling

### New Configuration Options

```bash
# Fragment detection settings (optional)
FRAGMENT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.3
ENABLE_FRAGMENT_DETECTION=true
MIN_STATEMENT_TEXT_LENGTH=200
MIN_CRITICAL_ELEMENTS=2
```

### Logging Enhancements
- Fragment detection logs: `WARNING - Detected fragment page at X-Y`
- Filtering logs: `WARNING - Skipping fragment with confidence 0.X`
- Validation logs: `Page count matches: X pages (skipped Y fragment pages)`

## 📚 Documentation Updates

### New Documentation
- **Fragment Detection Guide**: Comprehensive guide to fragment handling
- **Enhanced Troubleshooting**: Fragment-related issue resolution
- **Architecture Updates**: Updated workflow diagrams and descriptions

### Updated Documentation
- **What's New**: Added fragment detection to latest features
- **Workflow Overview**: Updated with fragment filtering details
- **CLI Commands**: Updated examples with fragment handling

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### Automatic Migration
No action required - fragment detection is enabled by default and backward compatible.

### Configuration (Optional)
Add to your `.env` file to customize fragment detection:

```bash
# Adjust fragment filtering sensitivity (default: 0.3)
FRAGMENT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.3

# Disable fragment detection if needed (not recommended)
ENABLE_FRAGMENT_DETECTION=false
```

### Monitoring
Check logs for fragment detection messages:

```bash
grep "fragment" logs/statement_processing.log
```

## 📈 Performance Impact

- **Processing Time**: Minimal impact (< 5% increase due to fragment analysis)
- **Accuracy**: Significant improvement in fallback mode boundary detection
- **Output Quality**: Substantially cleaner separated documents
- **Memory Usage**: No significant change

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Coverage
- Added fragment detection test cases
- Enhanced boundary detection validation
- Improved fallback mode testing

### Validation
- All 37 existing unit tests pass
- New fragment detection scenarios validated
- Regression testing completed

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned for v2.2
- Configurable fragment patterns
- Advanced confidence scoring algorithms
- Machine learning-based fragment detection
- Enhanced preview mode for fragment analysis

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues with fragment detection:
