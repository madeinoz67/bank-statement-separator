## Overview

The Bank Statement Separator is designed for people who need to process single PDF files containing multiple bank statements. It uses advanced AI models to intelligently identify statement boundaries, extract metadata, and create separate PDF files for each statement.

!!! tip "Production Ready"
This system is production-ready with comprehensive error handling, document management integration, and robust testing. All 37 unit tests are passing with full feature coverage.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses OpenAI GPT models for intelligent boundary detection
- **LangGraph Workflow**: Stateful 8-node processing pipeline with error recovery
- **Smart Metadata Extraction**: Automatically extracts account numbers, statement periods, and bank names
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple PDF files from directories with pattern filtering
- **Paperless-ngx Integration**: Automatic upload to paperless-ngx document management with auto-creation
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Advanced quarantine system with detailed error reports and recovery suggestions
- **Document Validation**: Pre-processing validation with configurable strictness levels
- **Security-First Design**: Secure credential management and file access controls
- **Rich CLI Interface**: Beautiful multi-command interface with progress indicators and quarantine management
- **Audit Logging**: Complete processing trail for compliance requirements

## Advanced Error Handling and Resilience

The system implements sophisticated error handling with automatic recovery mechanisms to ensure reliable operation:

### Intelligent Backoff Mechanisms

- **Exponential Backoff with Jitter**: Automatically retries failed API requests with exponentially increasing delays (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...) plus random jitter (10%-100%) to prevent thundering herd problems
- **Rate Limiting Integration**: Token bucket algorithm with sliding window tracking prevents API quota exhaustion
- **Selective Retry Logic**: Only retries on recoverable errors (RateLimitError, timeouts) while failing immediately on permanent issues
- **Configurable Limits**: Adjustable retry attempts (default: 3) and delay caps (max: 60 seconds)

### Comprehensive Quarantine System

- **Automatic Document Isolation**: Failed documents are moved to quarantine with detailed error reports
- **Recovery Suggestions**: Actionable guidance provided for each error type (password removal, format repair, quota upgrades)
- **Validation Strictness Levels**: Configurable error handling from strict (high accuracy) to lenient (high success rate)
- **Error Report Generation**: JSON reports with timestamps, failure reasons, and system diagnostics

### Resilience Features

- **Fallback Processing**: Pattern-based boundary detection when AI services are unavailable
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Temporary service suspension during persistent failures
- **Resource Management**: Memory and disk monitoring with graceful degradation
- **Audit Trail**: Complete error history for compliance and troubleshooting

## Quick Start

Get started in just a few minutes:

=== "Installation"

    ```bash
    # Clone the repository
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd bank-statement-separator

    # Install dependencies
    uv sync
    ```

=== "Configuration"

    ```bash
    # Copy configuration template
    cp .env.example .env

    # Edit with your settings
    nano .env
    ```

=== "First Run"

    ```bash
    # Test with dry-run
    uv run bank-statement-separator \
      process statements.pdf --dry-run --yes

    # Process single document
    uv run bank-statement-separator \
      process statements.pdf -o ./output --yes

    # Process batch of documents
    uv run bank-statement-separator \
      batch-process /path/to/pdfs -o ./batch-output --yes
    ```
